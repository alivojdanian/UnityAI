# Using Artificial Intelligence in Unity

### Autonomously Moving Agents

### Prerequisites

C# and Unity (2019.4.1f1)

### Description

Creating believable game characters using AI techniques

Working with NavMesh agents to recreate steering behaviors to create non-player characters that move around independently in a game environment and make choices about their movements based on the location and orientation of the player character

This is a course project of Artificial Intelligence for Master of Digital Learning Games in Tallinn University

### AI in this project

6 different AI have been used in this project.

**#1 AI (Seek):**

One agent seeks the other agent

**#2 AI (Flee):**

One agent flees from the other agent

**#3 AI (Pursuit):**

Adding pursuit behavior and understanding differences between seek and pursuit

**#4 AI (Evade):**

Using evade to show agent move away from predicted location of the target

**#5 AI (Wander):**

Producing wander behavior that will have the agent freely walk around the environment with smooth randomness

**#6 AI (Hide):**

Hiding one agent from the other one. Agent hides behind the closest obstacle in the environment. 

### How to use

Each AI behavior has been commented. Hence, for playing each of them just uncomment that one to see that behavior.
